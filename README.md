## Agent Chat

The autonomous AI agent capable of development assists your development process. It provides functionality similar to AI assistants like [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline), but with its own UI that doesn't depend on editors like VS Code. This enables richer diagramming and interactive experiences in Bedrock Engineer's agent chat feature. Additionally, with agent customization capabilities, you can utilize agents for use cases beyond development.

- 💬 Interactive chat interface with human-like Amazon Nova, Claude, and Meta llama models
- 📁 File system operations (create folders, files, read/write files)
- 🔍 Web search capabilities using Tavily API
- 🏗️ Project structure creation and management
- 🧐 Code analysis and improvement suggestions
- 📝 Code generation and execution
- 📊 Data analysis and visualization
- 💡 Agent customization and management
- 🛠️ Tool customization and management
- 🔄 Chat history management
- 🌐 Multi-language support
- 🛡️ Guardrail support
- 💡 Light processing model for cost optimization

Nova Sonic Voice Chat provides a more natural and intuitive AI interaction experience, different from traditional text-based exchanges. Voice communication enables efficient and approachable AI assistant experiences.

### Resolving Duplicate Permission Dialogs

If you experience duplicate OS permission dialogs (such as microphone access), you can resolve this issue by running the following command after building and installing the application to add an ad-hoc signature:

```bash
sudo codesign --force --deep --sign - "/Applications/Bedrock Engineer.app"
```

This command applies an ad-hoc code signature to the application, which helps prevent duplicate system permission dialogs.

## Website Generator

Generate and preview website source code in real-time. Currently supports the following libraries, and you can interactively generate code by providing additional instructions:

- React.js (w/ Typescript)
- Vue.js (w/ Typescript)
- Svelte.js
- Vanilla.js

Here are examples of screens generated by the Website Generator:

| ![website-gen](./assets/website-generator.png) | ![website-gen-data](./assets/website-generator-data-visualization.png) | ![website-gen-healthcare](./assets/website-generator-healthcare.png) |
| :--------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|          House Plant E-commerce Site           |                           Data Visualization                           |                           Healthcare Blog                            |

- Tailwind.css
- Material UI (React mode only)

### Agentic-RAG (Connect to Design System Data Source)

By connecting to Amazon Bedrock's Knowledge Base, you can generate websites referencing any design system, project source code, or website styles.

You need to store source code and crawled web pages in the knowledge base in advance. When registering source code in the knowledge base, it is recommended to convert it into a format that LLM can easily understand using methods such as [gpt-repository-loader](https://github.com/mpoon/gpt-repository-loader). Figma design files can be referenced by registering HTML and CSS exported versions to the Knowledge Base.

Click the "Connect" button at the bottom of the screen and enter your knowledge base ID.

### Web Search Agent

Website Generator integrates a code generation agent that utilizes web search capabilities. This feature allows you to generate more sophisticated websites by referencing the latest library information, design trends, and coding best practices. To use the search functionality, click the "Search" button at the bottom of the screen to enable it.

## Step Functions Generator

Generate AWS Step Functions ASL definitions and preview them in real-time.

![step-functions-generator](./assets/step-functions-generator.png)
